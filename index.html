        <h2>What is it?</h2>
        <p>Gofer is a jQuery plugin for instant and seamless page transitions. The only thing you absolutely need for it to work is a browser that supports <code>history.pushState</code> and <code>sessionStorage</code>, however it works best when at least some of the following are true:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>You have a decent idea where your users might navigate to next.</strong>
            <p>If you have something a list of links like "Recent Posts" or "Related Articles", Gofer is probably right for you. The whole idea is that if, in general, users are using your site in a predictable manner, do them a favor and fetch the content they want before they ask for it.</p>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Your pages have a similar HTML structure.</strong>
            <p>Gofer works by selecting elements with jQuery and replacing their contents. For instance on a blog, the post content might be found in <code>&lt;article class=".blog-post"&gt;</code>. This is perfect, since if we're looking for another post, we can go get a page and look for the content in the element(s) on that page that match <code>article.blog-post</code>. </p>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Your users hate waiting.</strong>
            <p>They do.</p>
          </li>
        </ol>
